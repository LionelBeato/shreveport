# I/O and Exceptions


## I/O

- I/O refers to your system's standard input and standard output. These are the standard stream. In addition to in and out there is also standard error.
- We can use this property of our computers by referring to the `System` class. This is what `System.out.println()` is doing! It's utilizing standard out.
- There are many classes that help us with I/O in Java. Some of these will help us manipulate streams directly. 
- Streams can be thought of a "flow" of data. Typically, from one source to one destination.
- I/O manipulation handles whats known as checked exceptions. These need to be handled in some way before being utilized.
