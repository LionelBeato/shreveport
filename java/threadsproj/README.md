# Threads -  Wednesday Jan 27, 2021

_When computers were first hitting the mainstream, multitasking was something of a luxury. Eventually, computers were able to simulate simultaneous tasks by utilizing process interrupts. Systems were sturdy enough that app-switching felt natural and smooth. In computing terms, this is known as contex switching._

_Developers soon realized that some processes can be more effectively handled if they were composed of multiple lightweight processes that simply shared resources. These lightweight processes are whats known as threads._

## Thread of Execution

- A thread is what's known as a _thread of execution_. It's the smallest set of instructions that can resolve. 
- They can indeed be thought of as a _lightweight task_. 
- Threads execute in something known as a _process_. A process is what you would consider a computer application or program.

## Synchronization

- What is synchronization? synchronization is the tool we utilize to avoid thread interference and memory consistency errors.
  - _this is synchronization as in "working together", not necessarily occuring at one and in the same way._
- One thing to note is that synchronization can also cause thread contention. This is when two or more threads try to access the same resource simultaneously. Note the blocking code example below. 
- A simple solution to invoke the `Thread` method `.join()`. This method will put the calling thread into a waiting state. It will remain in said state until the referenced thread terminates. This allows for inter-thread synchronization.
- `.join()` creates a _happens-before_ relationship. All actions in the thread _happen-before_ any other thread successfully returns from a `.join()` on that thread.

## Deadlock and Blocking Code

- Blocking code is any code that prevents further code from executing.
- Threads can execute blocking code indefinitely, causing what's known as a _deadlock_.
- Deadlocked code will typically result from variables utilized between multiple thread; if states are in the process of being changed, then neither thread will resolve. Observe the following code:

    ```java
    public class Deadlock {
        static class Friend {
            private final String name;
    
            public String getName() {
                return name;
            }
    
            public Friend(String name) {
                this.name = name;
            }
    
            public synchronized void bow(Friend bower) {
                System.out.format("%s: %s has bowed to me! %n",
                        this.name, bower.getName());
                bower.bowBack(this);
            }
    
            public synchronized void bowBack(Friend bower) {
                System.out.format("%s: %s has bowed back to me! %n",
                        this.name, bower.getName());
            }
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            final Friend alphonse = new Friend("Alphonse");
            final Friend gaston = new Friend("Gaston");
    
            new Thread(() -> alphonse.bow(gaston)).start();
            new Thread(() -> gaston.bow(alphonse)).start();
        }
    }
    ```

  Both Alphonse and Gaston are forever in a state of invoking `bow()` and can never resolve that method. Why? `bow()` is invoking `bowBack()` which accepts the other bower object as an argument. The problem is that the other bower object is also in their `bow()` method and is also anticipating a bower. Neither bower can be accepted into the method due to how threads with synchronized codes work. Thus, this code is deadlocked and will run indefinitely.

## Notes

- Don't think too hard about this stuff. A lot of this material will be abstracted from you once we start utilizing _Spring_ and _Spring Boot_.
- You should understand what constitutes a thread, what constitutes a process, and how these are handled by a computer system. 
- _Multi-threaded_ refers to a form of parallelization for simultaneous processing. Processors are composed of multiple CPU cores. Work can be divided up between these cores and processed in parallel, thus saving time. 
- _Hyper-threaded_ refers to a CPU core that can run multiple threads in parallel. It's a proprietary Intel technology. Intel is moving away from HT implementation for a whole host of reasons, chief among them being security concerns. 
- Fun fact: there's a thread permutation known as a _fiber_. What's the difference? Threads rely on the operating system to context switch while fibers will yield their execution to another fiber. For this reason, they're also referred to as _cooperative_ multitasking. Threads utilization is what's known as _preemptive_ multitasking.[ยน](##references)
